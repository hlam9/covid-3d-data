We are dealing with 3d images, focusing mainly on these two data sets below. We pull the data from the Cancer Imaging Archive, specifically the Medical Imaging Data Resource Center (MIDRC). We chose to focus on the lungs, and identifying and comparing different lungs in order to determine the likelyhood of being infected by COVID-19.

MIDRC-RICORD-1A-419639-000082 # This data set contains the infected lung

MIDRC-RICORD-1B-419639-000340 # This data set contains the normal lung

For segmentation:

We are able to segment out the lung, create a mask, change the color of it, and change the background to black.

For registration:

We are able to align the images and compare the results

For quantification:
